 Mark ThreadGroup created by FailOnTimeout as a daemon group. 
  
 Previously, FailOnTimeout destroyed the ThreadGroup, which could cause race conditions if the ThreadGroup was referenced by other threads.

 We are using Maven 3.1.1 which by default uses HTTP instead of HTTPS for 
 resolving artifacts from Maven Central. Maven Central recently 
 discontinued HTTP support. Therefore the build on Travis started 
 failing. By using an HTTPS mirror of Maven Central the build on Travis 
 will work again. 
  
 I chose Google's mirror because Travis uses this mirror by default, too. 
 I did not upgrade to a new version of Maven because there is no newer 
 version with Java 5 support and it should be possible to build JUnit 4 
 with Java 5 so that we can easily ensure that it works with Java 5.","Use Google's Maven Central mirror
