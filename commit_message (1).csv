EPL is the successor version of the CPL this makes re-licensing
possible without seeking the approval of all contributors.

* Netbeans can't ship JUnit [4]
* OpenJDK uses TestNG instead of JUnit [5]

https://github.com/square/okhttp/commit/92e64f0279f1ce10ddd280fe048a92f6a959203d,"Partially revert connection timeout behavior 
  
 Related to issue #1790. 
  
 If there is a *connection* timeout the next route should 
 be tried. Timeouts during a request/response should 
 probably not be retried. 
  
 The timeout/interrupt behavior was changed in PR #1257 
 for issue #1146. This modified both connection and 
 request/response behavior. The issue reported was actually 
 about the use of Thread.interrupt(), not timeouts, but the 
 behavior change modified both behavior for interrupt and 
 timeout. 
  
 PR #1388 split the handling of exceptions so that separate 
 code now handles connection errors from that which handles 
 request/response errors. It faithfully kept the behavior 
 from PR #1257. 
  
 The modification of the timeout behavior during *connection* 
 caused problems on Android. Now that the two types of error 
 handling are split it's possible to deal with them 
 differently and return the connection behavior to trying 
 the next route. This does not modify behavior during 
 request/response.","Partially revert connection timeout behavior
Related to issue #1790.
If there is a *connection* timeout the next route should
be tried. Timeouts during a request/response should
probably not be retried.
The timeout/interrupt behavior was changed in PR #1257
for issue #1146. This modified both connection and
request/response behavior. The issue reported was actually
about the use of Thread.interrupt(), not timeouts, but the
behavior change modified both behavior for interrupt and
timeout.
PR #1388 split the handling of exceptions so that separate
code now handles connection errors from that which handles
request/response errors. It faithfully kept the behavior
from PR #1257.
The modification of the timeout behavior during *connection*
caused problems on Android. Now that the two types of error
handling are split it's possible to deal with them
differently and return the connection behavior to trying
the next route. This does not modify behavior during
request/response.",Why and What,False,False,

 When a custom management.port is used, the child context is configured 
 with an EmbeddedServletContainerFactory bean that has the same class 
 as the parent context’s EmbeddedServletContainerFactory bean. This 
 ensures that the child context uses the same type of embedded container 
 as its parent when there are multiple embedded containers on the 
 classpath. It also causes a failure when the custom 
 EmbeddedServletContainerFactory subclass cannot be instantiated, for 
 example because it’s an anonymous inner-class. 
  
 This commit improves the diagnostics so that we fail fast with an 
 information exception message when we detect that the embedded servlet 
 container factory bean’s class cannot be instantiated.

 This is quite a big step, but I think it helps a lot. Since Spring 
 Boot always creates an AuthenticationManager if it doesn't find one

 Spring Security does not register its AuthenticationManager by 
 default though, so we have to do that for it if the user has created 
 one with an @Autowired AuthenticationManagerBuilder, but not registered 
 it as a @Bean. 
  
 Having the @Bean (marked @Primary to prevent issues with @Autowired) 
 makes it easier to reason about what Spring Boot has done for you, and 
 easier to default in simple use cases to the boot-created 
 AuthenticationManager. For example, if I want an OAuth2 Authorization 
 Server with password grant, it makes total sense for the 
 AuthenticationManager for users to be the same as the @Primary one.
